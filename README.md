#### DR QUINE [42 project]

[Project specifications PDF](./DOCS/dr_quine.en.pdf)

A quine is a computer program (a kind of metaprogram) whose output and source code
are identical. As a challenge or for fun, some programmers try to write the shortest quine
in a given programming language

For this project, you will have to recode three different programs, each with different
properties. Each programs will have to be coded in C and in Assembly, and respectivly
in a folder named C and ASM, each folders containing its own Makefile with the usual rules.
