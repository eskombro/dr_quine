#### DR QUINE [42 project]

[Project specifications PDF](./DOCS/dr_quine.en.pdf)

A **quine** is a computer program (a kind of metaprogram) whose **output and source code
are identical**. As a challenge or for fun, some programmers try to write the shortest quine
in a given programming language

For this project, you will have to recode three different programs, each with different
properties. Each program will have to be coded in C and in Assembly, and respectively
in a folder named **C and ASM**, each folder containing it's own Makefile with the usual rules.

The only Bonus accepted during p2p is to **redo this project entirely in the
language of your choice**.
